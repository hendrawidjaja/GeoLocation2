GeoLocation v2
============

This my university project. It is an android based game. The real game is called "Scotland Yard". In this project we are working in a Team. And I have the responsible to handle Geo Location. This my 2nd version. In the 1st version was a test but working app. Well it was too buggy. I used LocationManager and googleMaps. But in this 2nd version I use LocationClient, remove the googleMaps, replace it with cropped-picture. There are a lot of improvement since then. LocationClient improves the accuracy from 40 to 60%  (before was 30meters, now 8-12meters). Requesting time is downgraded from 30s to 12s but it depends on the respond of the cell-line tower. The awesomeness is battery drain, it really cuts upto 30% from previous method by using locationClient. Really awesome heh!

Also, if you find any bug or like to contribute to make this better, please do it but contact me before that. OR if you want to use this code or wondering how to use this code, just send me an Email. Thank you!
